gnuradio (3.6.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Build system changes
  
    Added support for setting SYSCONFDIR
    
  * Top-level component changes

    A new top-level component, gr-filter, has been created. This component
    implements all the filter-related functionality that is in
    gnuradio-core, and uses the new style 3.7 API. The filter blocks in
    gnuradio-core are now deprecated; but will remain in gnuradio-core
    until the 3.7 release. Developers are encouraged to begin using the
    new blocks in preparation.
    
  * New signal processing blocks
  
    gr_and_const_bb: adds bb type to gr_and_const* block
    gr_annotator_raw: allows tagging stream with pmt key, value pair from
    outside GNU Radio
    gr_endian_swap: change item endianness through block
    gr_message_burst_source: turn received messages into a stream and tag them
    gr_tag_debug: debug display of all tags going through block`
    digital_gfsk_demod, digital_gfsk_mod: Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying
    modulator and demodulator
    
  * New feature additions
  
    Support has now been added for ARM processors that do not implement
    NEON. gr-uhd has added rx tagging for changes in sample rate and
    center frequency.
    Added support for serializing pmt tuples
    Added BER/SNR simulation example
    Removed gruel dependency on inet.h
    
  * Bug fixes
  
    core: fix minor bug in gri_wavefile endian swapping
    core: only check for *.conf in preferences directory
    digital: fixed incorrect variable name in qam_demod XML
    digital: fix FLL block to use fir_filter
    digital: remove unused parameter from DPSK demod GRC block

gnuradio (3.0-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * reworked package dependencies so that the 'gnuradio' binary package no
    longer depends on the pieces in contrib.  instead, the 'usrp' binary
    package in contrib now depends on all the USRP-related pieces.  A user
    who doesn't have a USRP board can just install 'gnuradio' and get all
    the relevant pieces, a USRP user needs to install both 'gnuradio' and
    'usrp'.  Closes: #394533
  * improve consistency of references to 'GNU Radio' as upstream project name
  * make the gnuradio package dependencies on python-gnuradio and python-usrp
    be version specific on suggestion from Ramakrishnan Muthukrishnan

 -- Bdale Garbee <bdale@gag.com>  Fri, 10 Nov 2006 00:39:38 -0800

gnuradio (3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new maintainer, new upstream version
  * Restructuring source and binary packages to follow upstream changes, more
    or less repackaging from scratch taking ideas from the previous packaging
    by Ramakrishnan Muthukrishnan and Steinar H. Gunderson.  This single
    source package replaces all of:
        gnuradio-core
        gnuradio-examples
        gr-audio-alsa
        gr-audio-jack
        gr-audio-oss
        gr-usrp
        gr-wxgui
        usrp
    In addition, the 'gnuradio' binary package is a new meta-package that
    conveniently depends on everything gnuradio related to ease installation.
