gnuradio (3.6.3~rc0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Addition/upgrade of message passing infrastructure (Tim O'Shea, Tom
    Rondeau, Johnathan Corgan, Josh Blum)
  
  This introduces the ability to add and connect formally defined
  asychronous message ports to signal processing blocks and
  hierarchical blocks. These message ports can be connected to pass
  asynchronous data in the form of PMTs (polymorphic types) among
  blocks in a flowgraph. It is also possible to implement pure
  message passing blocks that have no requirement for streaming
  ports or work functions.
  
  We've also introduced the concept of PDUs (Protocol Data Units) as
  a convention for passing data+metadata using the new messaging
  ports. A PDU is a PMT pair that combines a PMT dictionary of
  metadata keys/values along with a PMT blob to hold a vector of
  data in memory.
  
  A few new general purpose blocks supporting these capabilties are
  in gnuradio-core:
  
  gr_message_debug
  gr_message_strobe
  gr_tagged_stream_to_pdu
  gr_pdu_to_tagged_stream
  
  Two new blocks for interfacing with networking stacks using the
  new PDU semantics:
  
  gr_socket_pdu
  gr_tuntap_pdu
  
  This new message passing capability and PDU convention is aimed at
  providing the infrastructure to better support software radio
  implementations using packet-oriented semantics, such as MAC-layer
  processing.

  * Addition of new Python-based signal processing blocks (Josh Blum)
  
  This feature, originally introduced by Josh Blum as part of
  GrExtras, allows implementing signal processing blocks directly in
  Python, and has now become a standard feature of GNU Radio.

  * Addition of gr-analog top-level component (Tom Rondeau)
  
  This implements the current gnuradio-core signal processing blocks
  used for analog signal processing into their own top-level
  component, gr-analog, and uses the new 3.7 API organization. The
  original blocks in gnuradio-core will be removed on the 3.7 branch
  prior to 3.7 release.

  * Addition of gr-blocks top-level component (Johnathan Corgan)
  
  This implements a large portion of the gnuradio-core non-signal
  processing blocks in the 3.7 API form. The original blocks in
  gnuradio-core will be removed on the 3.7 branch prior to 3.7
  release.
  
  * Metadata file source and sink blocks (Tom Rondeau)
  
  Two new blocks implement enhanced file source and sink blocks that
  incorporate metadata passed using the stream tags feature in GNU
  Radio. It is now possible to store things like frequency and
  sample rate into capture files, or whatever key/value pairs you
  tag onto data streams inside a flowgraph.
  
  http://www.trondeau.com/home/2012/12/15/metadata-file-format.html
  
  * GNU Radio buffer latency control (Tim O'Shea, Tom Rondeau)
  
  For finer-grained control over latency inside a GNU Radio
  flowgraph, it is now possible to adjust, on a per-block basis, the
  maximum noutput_items that will be used to call a block work
  function. In addition, it is possible to set the maximum size an
  output buffer can grow to before a work function is called.

  * New GNU Radio Companion (GRC) capabilities
  
  Added optional flag to pad source and sink (Josh Blum)
  Added wildcard type to pad source and sink (Josh Blum)
  Added ability to reload XML for block (Tim O'Shea)
  Added ability to automatically create hier_blocks
        from a flowgraph (Tim Newman)
  Added ability to open custom GRC hier block definitions (Tim O'Shea)
  Added new grcc command line GRC-to-Python utility (Tom Rondeau)

  * New Documentation Updates (Tom Rondeau)
  
  We are introducing documentation into the Doxygen manual
  describing features and capabilities of GNU Radio, above and
  beyond just documenting the API functions. Tom Rondeau has
  written about this here:
  
  http://www.trondeau.com/home/2012/12/18/new-documentation-for-new-features.html
  
  Some examples of commits where this has been done:
  
  gnuradio.org/cgit/gnuradio.git/commit/?id=77ea309 (PMT type usage)
  gnuradio.org/cgit/gnuradio.git/commit/?id=a21c5f7 (Message passing interface)
  gnuradio.org/cgit/gnuradio.git/commit/?id=996e599 (Metatdata format)
  gnuradio.org/cgit/gnuradio.git/commit/?id=5fcb7eb (Max output buffer control)

  * Other new features:
  
  Allow file source to open new files while running (Brett L. Trotter)
  Allow source blocks to return none/yield (Josh Blum)
  Improved capabilities of uhd_fft.grc example in gr-uhd (Ben Hilburn)
  Added parameter in qtgui sink's GRC block
        to set the update rate (Julien Olivain)
  Added source block hook in gr-uhd for issue stream cmd (Josh Blum)
  Added cmake package support for Ubuntu 12.10 (Nicholas Corgan)
  Added gr::blocks::patterned_interleaver (Tim O'Shea)
  Allow user to set Python path during cmake configuration (Tom Rondeau)
  Enabled serialize/deserialize for PMT vectors (Tom Rondeau)
  Added unsigned long long int support to the PMT sugar functions (Tom Rondeau)
  Allow using pmt_init_Xvector methods in python (Tom Rondeau)

    gnuradio-core, and uses the new style 3.7 API. The filter blocks in
    gnuradio-core are now deprecated; but will remain in gnuradio-core
    until the 3.7 release. Developers are encouraged to begin using the
    new blocks in preparation.

gnuradio (3.0-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * reworked package dependencies so that the 'gnuradio' binary package no
    longer depends on the pieces in contrib.  instead, the 'usrp' binary
    package in contrib now depends on all the USRP-related pieces.  A user
    who doesn't have a USRP board can just install 'gnuradio' and get all
    the relevant pieces, a USRP user needs to install both 'gnuradio' and
    'usrp'.  Closes: #394533
  * improve consistency of references to 'GNU Radio' as upstream project name
  * make the gnuradio package dependencies on python-gnuradio and python-usrp
    be version specific on suggestion from Ramakrishnan Muthukrishnan

gnuradio (3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new maintainer, new upstream version
  * Restructuring source and binary packages to follow upstream changes, more
    or less repackaging from scratch taking ideas from the previous packaging
    by Ramakrishnan Muthukrishnan and Steinar H. Gunderson.  This single
    source package replaces all of:
        gnuradio-core
        gnuradio-examples
        gr-audio-alsa
        gr-audio-jack
        gr-audio-oss
        gr-usrp
        gr-wxgui
        usrp
    In addition, the 'gnuradio' binary package is a new meta-package that
    conveniently depends on everything gnuradio related to ease installation.
