gnuradio (3.0-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * reworked package dependencies so that the 'gnuradio' binary package no
    longer depends on the pieces in contrib.  instead, the 'usrp' binary
    package in contrib now depends on all the USRP-related pieces.  A user
    who doesn't have a USRP board can just install 'gnuradio' and get all
    the relevant pieces, a USRP user needs to install both 'gnuradio' and
    'usrp'.  Closes: #394533
  * improve consistency of references to 'GNU Radio' as upstream project name
  * make the gnuradio package dependencies on python-gnuradio and python-usrp
    be version specific on suggestion from Ramakrishnan Muthukrishnan

gnuradio (3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new maintainer, new upstream version
  * Restructuring source and binary packages to follow upstream changes, more
    or less repackaging from scratch taking ideas from the previous packaging
    by Ramakrishnan Muthukrishnan and Steinar H. Gunderson.  This single 
    source package replaces all of: 
        gnuradio-core
        gnuradio-examples
        gr-audio-alsa
        gr-audio-jack
        gr-audio-oss
        gr-usrp
        gr-wxgui
        usrp
    In addition, the 'gnuradio' binary package is a new meta-package that 
    conveniently depends on everything gnuradio related to ease installation.
