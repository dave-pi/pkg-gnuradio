h2: @libvolk@ VOLK Library Improvements

This release cycle has seen a large amount of work done to the VOLK library, through efforts led by Nathan West and the VOLK Working Group.

Compile-time improvements were made to support Windows, better clang support, and saving compiler flags. Compiler flags and other build-time variables are preserved and can be accessed through a new utility app, @volk-config-info@ that is very similar to @gnuradio-config-info@. The QA had several fixes and improvements to fix false positives for negative floating point results and using EVM for complex results rather than checking real and imaginary parts as a single stream of floats. The QA and volk_profile now report results in ms, and adds a benchmark mode (-b) that runs all kernels even if
there is only one protokernel available.

Several kernels had unaligned protokernel copied from aligned versions, and others had bug fixes. The unused @spu_lib@ directory of protokernels was removed. This list of kernel modifications includes:

* @32fc_s32fc_x2_rotator_32fc@ (bug fixes in all protokernels)
* @32f_x2_sum_of_poly_32f@ (add AVX protokernels)
* @32fc_32f_multiply_32fc@ (add aligned avx protokernel)
* @32fc_32f_dot_prod_32fc@ (add AVX protokernels)
* @32f_invsqrt_32f@ (add AVX protokernel, tuning generic @q_rsqrt@))
* @32fc_x2_dot_prod_32fc@ (add unaligned protokernels, performance tuning)
* @8i_convert_16i@ (remove duplicate entry)

The VOLK core library saw three notable fixes. First, the machine definitions for ARM were split in to @hardfp@ and @softfp@. Second, @get_machine@ was patched for thread safety. Finally, the addition of @volk_malloc@ and @volk_free@, replacements for similar allocators such as @posix_malloc@, @fftw_malloc@, etc. This should be used whenever creating a buffer for use in VOLK.

A new regex option (-R) to @volk_profile@ allows running profiling on kernels matching the given regex. The @volk_config@ is not written when using a regex. The benchmark mode is now implicitly true.

VOLK modtool now brings in (and deletes) ORC protokernels when adding or removing kernels by name.

The following kernels have unaligned protokernels copied from aligned versions:

* @32fc_32f_dot_prod_32fc@
* @16i_32fc_dot_prod_32fc@
* @32fc_x2_dot_prod_16i@
