Release 3.7.4.1 is a bug-fix only increment, while release 3.7.5 adds
both bug fixes and new features within the 3.7 API compatibility
series.  We'd like to thank the below contributors for their efforts:

Major Changes: (3.7.5 only)

GNU Radio Companion (Sebastian Koslowski, Seth Hitefield)

The GNU Radio Companion, a graphical front-end for creating GNU Radio
flowgraphs, has been the focus of new features and usability
improvements for several releases now.  Release 3.7.5 continues this
trend, adding snap-to-grid, (optional) hiding of port names, and
saving of console output.  In addition, newly created or saved GRC
files will have version information embedded into them, to facilitate
better handling of GRC upgrades in the future.


CMake Build System (Michael Dickens)

The CMake build system has received a lot of attention this release,
though most of the changes are not visible to end users.  In
particular, however, was correcting a long-standing serious bug in
performing parallel GNU Radio builds across multiple core processors.
This actually required a workaround to an existing CMake bug. End
users and package maintainers that compile GNU Radio from scratch can
now reliably take advantage of the full capabilities of their
processors.


QTGUI Graphics System (Tom Rondeau, Martin Braun)

GNU Radio has long included two separate graphics systems for
producing display output--one based on wxWidgets (gr-wxgui) and the
other based on the QT windowing system (gr-qtgui.)  Until recently, of
the two, gr-wxgui has been the more full featured and mature.  This
release has focused on reaching feature parity between the two, with
the goal of deprecating gr-wxgui in the future 3.8 release series and
eventual removal (someday) in 3.9.

To help developers understand how to begin updating their GRC
flowgraphs to use gr-wxgui, all of the supplied GRC examples in GNU
Radio 3.7.5 now use QT.

Beginning in release 3.7.6, the default option for new flowgraphs in
GRC will be to use QT, though of course developers may still use WX if
desired.


New Digital Television Component (Andrew Davis, Johnathan Corgan)

One of the very first applications for GNU Radio many years ago was an
implementation of the North American ATSC digital television standard.
Given processing hardware at the time, the receiver was not able to
demodulate in real time; one had to record raw RF as IQ samples to a
file, then play that file back through the demodulator at a much
slower rate.

Andrew Davis has done a partial rewrite and cleanup of this code base,
to the point where it is now possible on an Intel Core I7 processor to
receive, demodulate, and display in real time HD quality ATSC DTV.

GNU Radio 3.7.5 has a new top-level component, gr-dtv, which
incorporates this receiver code.  Our plan is to do the same for the
ATSC transmitter codebase, then incorporate third party donated
implementations of DVB-T, DVB-S, and DVB-S2. In addition, as this is
done, we will take the opportunity to reuse as many existing blocks in
gr-analog, gr-digital, gr-filter, and gr-fec as possible in order to
help demonstrate the use of these blocks in complex radio standards.


The GNU Radio Live DVD

Concurrent with this release of GNU Radio 3.7.5 is a new,
built-from-scratch bootable live DVD, based on the Ubuntu 14.04
long-term support release.  Hardware support is included for the Ettus
Research USRP product series, Great Scott Gadgets HackRF series, Nuand
bladeRF products, and RTL2832U-based USB dongles (RTLSDRs).

In addition, the PyBOMBS installer application was used to incorporate
a wide range of third party GNU Radio applications, including:

* gr-osmosdr, a set of blocks supporting various hardware SDRs and
applications
* gqrx, a narrowband SDR receiver application by Alexandru Csete
* GNSS-SDR, a fully software-based GPS, Galileo, and GLONASS real time
receiver
* gr-air-modes, a Mode-S/ADSB aircraft telemetry receiver
* gr-dvbs2, a software defined DVB-S2 digital television transmitter
* gr-dvbt, a software defined DVB-T digital television transceiver
* gr-ieee-80211, an IEEE 802.11a/g/p transceiver
* gr-ldpc, an implementation of generic LDPC codecs
* gr-lte, an implementation of a 3GPP LTE receiver
* gr-radar, the GNU Radio Radar Toolbox
* gr-rds, an implementation of broadcast FM radio RDS reception
* gr-specest, an implementation of several spectral estimation algorithms
* OpenLTE, an open source 3GPP LTE implementation
