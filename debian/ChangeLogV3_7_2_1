The bug fixes are mostly minor changes scattered throughout the tree.
However, a few issues were important enough to get corrected in a
maintenance release.

An issue was corrected in the UDP source and sink to allow operation over
localhost when no other network interfaces are present, which was causing
test failures in some environments. See issues #565 and #613.

Several longstanding issues in the VOLK library when operating on the
ARM architecture and elsewhere were corrected. See issues #569, #582,
#583, and #614. In addition, some fixes were also needed to work with
MacOSX 10.9.

The new QT Time Sink feature allowing triggering on stream tags had an
issue when there were no stream tags at all; this was fixed. See
issue #615.

The OFDM Header/Payload Demuxer block was throwing exceptions when
receiving a payload length that exceeded the maximum buffer size, this
was fixed to discard the packet instead. See issue #615.

The new GNU Radio Companion search feature had a remaining bug fixed
that was preventing the use of certain letters in the search entry.

The overall shortlog follows:
Alistair Bird (1):

    blocks: fix pdu_to_tagged_stream when saving leftover items

Martin Braun (6):

    runtime: fixed case where tagged stream blocks produce zero length tags
    digital: HPD fixes (burst ID tags are no more propagated; buffer sizes are halved to est. max output size)
    modtool: bugfixes for in-tree operation (include paths, license, cmake editing)
    digital: fix CID 1090058 and 1043272 in constellation
    digital: Fix CID 1043268 and 1043271
    modtool: dashes no longer allowed in modnames at all (fixes #619)

Michael Dickens (1):

    cmake: fixes for Apple (specifically; clang generically) to handle some missing AVX instructions.

Philip Balister (4):

    qa_fir_filter_with_buffer.cc : Fix incorrect use of sizeof().
    fir_filter.cc : Address Coverity sizeof not portable warnings.
    fir_filter.cc, fir_filter_with_buffer.cc : Address Coverity sizeof not portable warnings.
    dc_blocker_cc_impl.cc, dc_blocker_ff_impl.cc : Fix uninitialized pointer.

Sebastian Koslowski (2):

    blocks: allow extra header chunks in wav_file_source
    grc: fix search entry focus (again)

Sylvain Munaut (2):

    cmake: proper handling and exporting of ALL include dirs and libraries.
    cmake: patch that fixes scoping issue by re-declaring the variable in the parent scope.

Tim O'Shea (1):

    cmake: ensure GrPython is included before using methods from it in FindICE.cmake - needed when including only FindICE from OOT modules

Tom Rondeau (18):

    runtime: minor swig fix of declaring std_string.i. Need for OS X 10.9.
    digital: fixed simple warning on ofdm code.
    blocks: updated UDP source to handle no network connections by allowing use of loopback device. Also fixed an infrequent problem on shutdown before the thread exited.
    filter: fixed missing copyright and import sys in examples
    fft: optimization; bug fixes for kaiser window and added windows to win_type.
    qtgui: fix for issue #615.
    volk: naming error between orc file name and kernel name.
    volk: explicitly casting tolerance to float or unsigned int for passing to fcpmare or icompare in QA tests.
    blocks: loosen restriction on damping factor in control_loop class.
    digital: updated qa_mpsk_receiver to have similar tests in test01 and test02.
    digital: on 32-bit machines when M=4 using single-precision float was causing k=1. Using double-precision calculation here to avoid possible confusion and errors
    docs: fixed doxygen warning.
    docs: fixed exploring-gnuradio examples and added to doxygen manual.
    pmt: added class comparator to rename comperator (to be removed in 3.8).
    blocks: prevent alowing more input streams than this block uses.
    docs: fixed/modifying/adding documentation for blocks a-l.
    digital: fixed warnings about order of initializing variables in constellation.
